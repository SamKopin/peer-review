<p> With that many species of snakes only around 600 are venomous. (Don't worry though; only about 200 of those species can be lethal.)</p>
<p> Although with that many venomous snakes in the world, it's always a good idea to know the numbers to call, such as 911.</p>
<p> With how "scary" snakes can come off as they truly want nothing to do with you in the wild. They would only attack if you try to mess with them first. There is one snake in the world that will actively chase a human which is the Central American Bushmaster. It's scienctific name is "Lachesis stenophrys" and it resides in more of the tropical forest of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>

<!--specific facts on diet-->
<h3><u> Diet </u></h3>
<p>  These reptiles are carnivorous. Huge snakes such as boas, pythons, and anacondas can consume large animals. Smaller snakes though, consume smaller animals. The tinier snakes diet typically involves invertebrates and insects, though some can eat eggs.
Snakes eat whatever they can get. Their common resource for food are frogs, rats, chicken and the like The diet of the snakes varies according to the season, the animal that is available in plenty becomes their prey. Their diet counts a lot on their growth.
A few of them particularly consume warm blooded animals such as birds, rodents, and rabbits. Others will consume earthworms, slugs, eggs, other kinds of reptiles, fish, insects, amphibians or frogs. Snakes can't chew their food so they swallow their food in one piece.
If you're looking to own a snake it's always a good idea to do reasearch on the specific snake to check their diet and how to feed them. 
Not everyone would be comfortable feeding a hamster to even a rabbit to their snake.</p>

<p> - The amount of food a snake eats determines how many offspring it will have.</p>
<p> - Snakes typically need to eat only 6 to 30 meals each year to be healthy. </p>
<p> - The longest snake ever recorded is the reticulated python. It can reach over 33 feet long, which is big enough to swallow a pig, a deer, or even a person. </p>
