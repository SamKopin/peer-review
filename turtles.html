<!--facts about subcategories or families-->
    <p> With 351 species of these reptiles they're split into 14 families. </p>
    <p> These families each have their own description and identifiable features.</p>
    <!--#1-->
    <p> The first family group has the scienctific name of Carettochelyidae. </p>
      <p> These turtles have large bodies and a nose that looks similar to that of a pig, giving them their more known name. </p>

<!--#2-->
    <p> The second family group is the Chelidae. </p>
       <p> These turtles have necks that are so long that they fold sideways under their shells. (How Odd!)</p>

<!--#3-->
    <p> Our third family is the Cheloniidae. </p>
        <p>These turtles are commonly known as sea turtles, they have adapted features for ocean life such as large flippers, and streamlined bodies. </p>

<!--#6-->
    <p> This sixth family are Dermochelyidae. Also known as leatherback turtles. </p>

<!--#7-->
<p> The seventh family are the Emydidae.</p>

<!--#8-->
    <p> Our eighth turtle family are the Geoemydidae.</p>
    <p> Some of these turtles are highly aquatic, only showing up on land periodically to lay eggs. Other species are entirely land dwelling though.</p>

<!--#9-->
    <p> The ninth family of turtles are the Kinosternidae.</p>
    <p> Also knwon as mud or musk turtles, their name stems from the pungent musk they produce. They are rather tiny turtles as well.</p>
    <img src="mudturtle.jpg" alt="mud turtle">

<!--#10-->
    <p> This tenth family is the Pelomedusidae.</p>
    <p> Similar to the second family, Chelidae, these turtles usually fold their necks sideways rather than pulling them back straight into the shells, they just dont have the long necks.</p>
    <img src="africansideneck.jpg" alt="african sidenecked turtle">

<!--#11-->
    <p> The eleventh family is the Platysternidae.</p>
    <p>They are known as the big-headed turtle,  these turtles have a head that is disproportionately large compared to their small bodies.</p>
    <img src="bighead.jpg" alt="big headed turtle">

<!--#12-->
    <p>The twelfth family is the Podocnemididae.</p>
    <p>These turtles have their pelvis attached to the shell preventing them from any pelvic motion but they look like the Platysternidae family.</p>
    <img src="amazonbighead.jpg" alt="amazon big-head turtle">

<!--#13-->
    <p>This thirteenth family is surprising but they are the Testudinidae family</p>
    <p> More commonly known as tortoises, they are exclusively land-dwelling. They are strictly herbivorous feeding mostly on weeds, grasses flowers, and fruits. </p>
    <img src="tort.jpg" alt="tortoise">

<!--#14-->
    <p> This last family are the Trionychidae.</p>
    <p>They are soft shell turtles. They have shells that lack scutes making them very mobile in water.</p>

    <h3><u> Diet</u> </h3>
    <p> Turtles are omnivores, the only turtle family that is strictly herbivores are tortoises. Turtles will eat insects such as mealworms and crickets. They also eat vegetables such as kale and water-plants. Sea turtles will eat algae, squid, and jellyfish. What a turtle eats depends on the environment it lives in. </p>
